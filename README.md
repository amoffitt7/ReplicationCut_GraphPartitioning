Graph Generation code:
http://condor.depaul.edu/rjohnson/source/graph_ge.c

When you run the C code you will prompted to enter a number of vertices. 
The number you enter will be the maximum number of vertices in any given 
produced graph. The first graph will have 3 vertices, the next 4, and so
on until the last graph has the number of vertices you entered.

Produced graphs are stored in the same directory/folder that the source
code is stored in. File names will be graphX where X is the number of
vertices in the graph displayed in the file.

You will also be prompted to enter a maximum edge weight, and this is
used exactly how you would imagine. Max edge weight is an upperbound
when generating random edge weights.
