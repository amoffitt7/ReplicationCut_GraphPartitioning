The matlab code requires a bit of editing to run properly. You must upload the distribution files to the same folder as the script. 
Then you must change the parameters in the script marked with "Change these numbers!" in order to plot according to the files you uploaded.
For example, if you uploaded "distribution_GraphFolder_10_100.txt" and "distribution_GraphFolder_11_100.txt" then you must change the line 
with "n = ..." to "n = 10:11".
