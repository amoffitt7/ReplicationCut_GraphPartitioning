# ReplicationCut_GraphPartitioning

## Running the java algorithm code - Eclipse
Once you have your folders created via running the c code, you  
need to first make a new folder in the java workspace you are using  
in the same directory/folder that already contains your bin and src  
folders (This is usually a folder above the folder storing the java   
code files). The folder needs to be called Main_Graph_Folder.  
Once you have made the new folder just transfer all of your  
graph containing folders into this new folder. Once you have done this  
you can now run the java code!  

To run the java code you just need to make a project and add these four  
files:  

 - MaxFlowMinCut.java
 - Run_Test.java
 - ReplicationCutAlgorithm.java
 - Cut.java
 - InfoCollector.java
 
 All of the results for each graph are stored in a new text file and are  
 stored in the same folder that the graph file is stored in.
