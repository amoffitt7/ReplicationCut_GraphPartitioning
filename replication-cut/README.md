# ReplicationCut_GraphPartitioning

## Running the java algorithm code  
Once you have your folders greated via running the c code, you  
need to first make a new folder in the java workspace you are using  
in the same directory/folder that already contains your bin and src  
folders. Once you have made the new folder just transfer all of your  
graph containing folders into this new folder. Once you have done this  
you can now run the java code where you just need to pass the name of  
the folder you just created as an argument.  

To run the java code you just need to make a project and add these four  
files:  

 - MaxFlowMinCut.java
 - Run_Test.java
 - ReplicationCutAlgorithm.java
 - Cut.java
 
 All of the results for each graph are stored in a new text file and are  
 stored in the same folder that the graph file is stored in.
